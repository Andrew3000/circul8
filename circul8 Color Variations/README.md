### Badges + Statusbars

* Move to the top of the list in Winterboard and activate.

### Boover badges

* You need the Boover tweak from Cydia.
* Move to the top of the list in Winterboard and activate.
* Find Boover inside apple settings/preferences app.
* Enable, Y 7 and X -10
* Respring using Winterboard (Boover respiring freezes my iPhone).
* Boover is a bit buggy so try reset, respring etc. if your badges aren’t where they are supposed to be.
* Also try: reset, respring, apply x, respring, apply y, respring if the badges aren’t placed correctly.
